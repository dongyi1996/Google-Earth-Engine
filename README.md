# Google Earth Engine
Hello everyone! In this folder, you will find tutorials and projects in which I used the Google Earth Engine platform.
The tutorials are hosted in the "Getting started" folder and are mainly intended for those who never worked with GEE, as there are very basic code. Those were the tutorials I followed when first started working with GEE. 
More advanced projects are presented by specific names, as follows:
- LST: Simple code to calculate Land Surface Temperature from Landsat thermal bands.
- Getting Started: Simple code to process satellite images.
- Kriging: Obtain interpolated values at unsampled locations by using kriging. The semivariogram parameters are not calculated here.
- Endmembers: GEE tutorial for calculating endmembers from landsat images.
