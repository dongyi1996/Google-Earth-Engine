# Getting endmembers from earth surfaces
Hello everyone!  
In my learning process of the Google Earth Engine platform, I will present here all the codes and tutorials I am practicing with.  
This time, I bring here the code to get endmembers of Earth surfaces. This tutorial is presented in the collection of video tutorials of the GEE, which you can find here: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/videos. Thus, these are copy codes, not actually mine. But I wanted to present here and share my experience when I am learning.  You can find the code here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/d877983d4cc55d7472702d4ae71d018c.  
I run this code using an image from my country, Paraguay, as you can see from the images below.
